// Write a function that takes in a number and returns the factorial of that number.
// A factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it.
// For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
// The factorial of 0 is 1.
// The factorial of 1 is 1.
// The factorial of 2 is 2 * 1 = 2.
// The factorial of 3 is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.
// Recommended: use a while of for loop to solve the problem
function findFactorial(n) {
  // Your code here
  if (n === 1) return n;
  let counter = 0;
  let result = 1;

  while (counter < n) {
    counter++;
    result *= counter;
  }
  return result;
}
